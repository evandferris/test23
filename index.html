        <p>The Serrif Project is a remote-based development initiative. Our objective is to deliver free web-based research tools to:</p>

        <ul>
           <li>Academic institutions in developing economies</li> 
           <li>Independent researchers and intellectuals seeking to develop their academic pursuits</li>
           <li>Non-Profit Organizations with a humanitarian and/or educational foundation</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Through the web, information is able to flow more freely than ever before. We are working together with a team of driven and experienced 
            individuals with a passion for the free exchange of information and the development of knowledge and academic spirit. We aim to bring these ideals to every 
            corner of the globe, narrowing our focus to developing countries and individuals seeking to contribute to academic pursuits.
